## How to Play
To play the game, follow these steps:
1. **Start the server:**  Run the 'server.py' with the desired number of players (1 for single-player mode, more for multiplayer mode).
   ```bash
   python server.py [number_of_players]
   ```
2. **Join the game:** Run 'client.py' and provide the server's IP address as an argument. If the server is running on the same machine, use 'localhost' as the IP address.
   ```bash
   python client.py [server_ip]
   ```
   Otherwise, you can find the server's IP address by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
    ipconfig
    ```

3. **Play the game:**
   - Use the WASD keys to control the movement of your snake.
      - W: Move up
      - A: Move left
      - S: Move down
      - D: Move right
   - Eat food to grow longer.
   - Avoid collisions with walls and other snakes (including your own).
   - Enjoy the game!
